                    <h1>FRESH QUALITY MEATS</h1>
                    <p>We work directly with American farmers to source high quality meat. Most of our animals are raised by local Amish farmers, who provide a high quality environment for the animals to grow in. With quality growth and development comes quality meat. </p>

                <h2>Let us introduce ourselves</h2>
                <p>Halal Meat House is a family owned and operated slaughterhouse that has been in business since 1997. Our priority is for our company, with the support of our farmers, to provide our customers with the best quality meats. Our goals far surpass that of just providing stores and consumers with meat, but to provide people with food that is both “good and pure”; allowing us to stay in line with our faith and traditional values. </p>

                <h2>WHY HALAL?</h2>
                <p>The word Halal in Arabic translates into 'good', ‘wholesome”, or 'sanctified'. The concept of halal food goes further than the literal meaning and is used in the Quran in conjunction with the word 'tayib', meaning pure, healthy or natural. We believe that raising—and slaughtering—our animals in a manner that is in-line with nature and with the proper welfare and and care for our animals in mind. You are what you eat, though a cliché, it rings with truth.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <h2>Cattle</h2>
                    <p>Halal beef has been certified to have been processed in a prescribed manner in accordance with Muslim dietary laws. Such as the animal not facing undue stress up until it is slaughtered. The slaughter must be performed by a Muslim.
                    Halal is an Arabic word meaning lawful or permitted. The opposite of halal is haram, which means unlawful or prohibited.  Halal and haram are universal terms that apply to all facets of life. However, we will use these terms only in relation to food products, meat products, cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food ingredients, and food contact materials.

                <h2>Sheep</h2>
                <p>Proponents of the halal slaughter method argue that the neck cut and subsequent heavy bleeding make the animal lose consciousness rapidly, and therefore, no pain occurs. A common method of slaughter in non-Islamic countries uses a bolt gun to stun animals before they are bled to death. Opponents of traditional halal slaughter are of the opinion that the bolt stunning method is instantaneous and ensures the animal does not feel pain when the slaughterer cuts the blood vessels and that larger animals like cattle may stay alive for minutes after the throat is cut.</p>

                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>The United States' population is ever-growing and diverse in its many ethnic, cultural, and religious groups. Halal meat consumers represent a major market segment, spending $20 billion on food every year,1 with chicken being the most common halal meat on menus.2
                    Now you can easily serve this in-demand meat and meet the diverse needs of your patrons, thanks to an extensive line of halal-certified SKUs—no need to manage more than one product line or pay extra for a halal certification.</p>
